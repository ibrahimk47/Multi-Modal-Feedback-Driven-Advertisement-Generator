# 🚀 Multi-Modal Feedback-Driven Advertisement Generation  
### Using NLP, Sentiment & Emotion Analysis

An AI-powered advertisement suggestion system that analyzes user feedback and images to generate personalized, emotion-aware marketing strategies.

---

## 📖 Overview

This project implements a Multi-Modal AI System that integrates:

- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Sentiment Analysis
- Emotion Detection
- Image Object Recognition
- Facial Emotion Analysis
- Advertisement Strategy Generation

The system processes both textual and visual inputs and generates intelligent advertisement suggestions based on emotional context and detected user intent.
